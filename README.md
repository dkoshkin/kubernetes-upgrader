# kubernetes-upgrader

// TODO(user): Add simple overview of use/purpose

## Description

// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

1.  Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

    ```sh
    make release-snapshot
    make docker-push IMG=ghcr.io/dkoshkin/kubernetes-upgrader:$(gojq -r '.version' dist/metadata.json)
    ```

1.  If using a local KIND cluster:

    ```sh
    kind load docker-image ghcr.io/dkoshkin/kubernetes-upgrader:$(gojq -r '.version' dist/metadata.json)
    ```

1.  Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

    ```sh
    make deploy IMG=ghcr.io/dkoshkin/kubernetes-upgrader:$(gojq -r '.version' dist/metadata.json)
    ```

1.  Install Instances of Custom Resources:

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f config/samples/
    ```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out

1.  Install the CRDs into the cluster:

    ```sh
    make install
    ```

1.  Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

    ```sh
    make run
    ```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
